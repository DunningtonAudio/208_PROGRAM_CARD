# 208_PROGRAM_CARD
A 208 program card project

These Model 208 Program Cards are designed to interface with the “PROGRAM BOARD” edge connector of a Buchla & Associates Model 208 Stored Program Sound Source module and its reissues / compatible units. Two versions are provided, one for standard use and one with a prototyping area where additional active circuitry can be added if desired. For guidance on general use, see Allen Strange’s “Programming and Meta-Programming the Electro Organism” manual.

Beyond the settings / connections available on the original cards, the following features are provided:

* A label area on the rear of the card for easy identification of presets.
* Modulation oscillator range switch setting (where this is available on the 208 edge connector).
* An extra connection point for each of the random voltage outputs.
* Footprints for optional multi-turn trimmer potentiometers (Bourns 3266W type) in series with the sequencer voltage level settings for fine tune when programming pitched sequences.
* 5V rail brought out to the prototyping area (where this is available on the 208 edge connector)

The repository contains:

* KiCad project files, including gerber outputs
* Schematic, notes and 208 manual as PDF files
